1. **EmailTemplateEngine**: Handles formatting utilities
   - Currency formatting (`$250,000`)
   - Deadline formatting with urgency indicators
   - Timeline formatting (`2 years, 6 months`)
   - Proposal variant emojis and descriptions

2. **NotificationAgent**: Main agent class
   - Complete data package processing
   - HTML email generation with professional styling
   - Plain text email generation for fallback
   - Subject line generation with personalization
   - Statistics and analytics generation
   - A2A message processing

#### Email Features
- **Professional HTML Design**: Gradient headers, styled cards, responsive layout
- **Content Organization**: Clear sections for opportunity details, research ideas, collaborators
- **Visual Indicators**: Emojis for variants (🛡️ Conservative, 💡 Innovative, 🚀 Stretch)
- **Urgency Handling**: Color-coded deadlines with warning indicators
- **Call-to-Action**: Prominent buttons for application access and support
- **Unsubscribe Links**: GDPR/CAN-SPAM compliance support

#### Data Integration
